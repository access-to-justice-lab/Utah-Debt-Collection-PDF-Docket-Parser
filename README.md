# Utah Docket Downloader
This program downloads and parses the PDF calendar docket from the Utah Court System. It then filters to find only debt collection cases and outputs the information for those hearings into a CSV. 
The website is https://www.utcourts.gov/cal/data/SLC_Calendar.pdf but the Court has indicated this PDF will be phased out in the future.

Requires PDFSharp.
